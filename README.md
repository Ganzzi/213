# Street Food SaiGon

Welcome to Street Food SaiGon, a web application that allows users to browse and discover the best street food in SaiGon, Vietnam. This project was built as part of a coding challenge and serves as a showcase for my coding abilities.

# Features

```

1. Browse street food stalls by category
2. View detailed information about each stall, including photos and reviews
3. Leave your own reviews and ratings for stalls
4. Search for stalls by name or category
5. Add new stalls to the database (requires authentication)
6. Edit or delete your own stall entries (requires authentication)

```

# Deployment
To deploy the application, you can use any cloud platform that supports Python applications. Some popular options include:

Heroku: a cloud platform that supports multiple programming languages, including Python
AWS Elastic Beanstalk: a fully managed service for deploying and scaling web applications
Google Cloud Platform: a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google
Before deploying the application, be sure to set the FLASK_ENV environment variable to 'production' in your .env file, and replace the DATABASE_URL with a production-ready database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
